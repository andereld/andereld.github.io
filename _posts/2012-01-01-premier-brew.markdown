I bottled my first batch of homebrewed beer some weeks ago. The process leading
up to that event was quite simple, and it was made even simpler by having
friends who brew and who willingly shared their knowledge. In the interest of
sharing that knowledge with more people still, I've written this account of my
experiences. As it details my first brew, this post should be taken as neither
a complete tutorial nor an example of excellence—the ‘premier’ in the title is
ordinal, not qualitative. Instead, consider it a taste of what's involved in
getting started with homebrewing.

### The effort

My first step was to acquire the following items:

#### Paraphernalia

- a 30 l pail, intended for brewing purposes, with volume markings on the side
- a lid for the pail with a hole and gasket for fitting an airlock
- an airlock
- a [hydrometer][hydrometer]
- a measuring cylinder which fits the hydrometer
- a siphon
- a twin-lever type bottle capper
- a funnel which fits into the opening of a beer bottle
- about 70 .33 l bottles
- crates to hold the bottles
- plastic buckets (for sanitizing bottles and equipment) and a ladle; I prefer
  to keep my brewing utensils dedicated to brewing purposes

#### Ingredients and consumables

- a (1.7 kg) can of malt extract
- 1 l of dextrose
- table sugar (sucrose)
- a bag of 70 bottle caps
- brewer's sanitizer

When I'd obtained these objects, I simply followed the instructions included
with the malt extract merged with a few tips from my brewing compadres. In
short:

1. Sanitize the pail and other equipment; instructions are printed on the
   packaging of the sanitizer
2. Bring 4 l of water to a boil
3. Mix the malt extract, boiling water and dextrose in the pail; stir thoroughly
4. Add cool water until you've got about 22–23 l of liquid
5. Make sure that the temperature is 20–30°C; apply the yeast and stir
   thoroughly once more
6. Take a cup of wort from the pail and fill the measuring cylinder; immerse the
   hydrometer and write down the value it shows for later reference

This constitutes the first part of the brewing process. The wort should now
be left to ferment for 4–5 days; you'll typically want to bottle it when
the value shown by the hydrometer has decreased from, say, 40°Oe ([degrees
Oechsle][Oechsle]) to about 7–8°Oe. This change in value comes from sugar
being converted into alcohol, leaving the specific gravity lower than that of
the sugar-rich wort you had to begin with. To calculate the ABV, divide that
difference by 7.5—e.g. <span class='math'>(40 - 8) / 7.5 = 4.27% ABV</span>.

The second part of the brewing proces is bottling the beer, which I did after
four days. The process was simple, but time-consuming. First, all of the
bottles need to be immersed in a mixture of water and sanitizer for 20 minutes
and then rinsed with warm water. The siphon and other equipment should also be
sanitized, of course. I used the plastic buckets for this, and with only two
buckets, I had to sanitize the bottles in three seperate batches. I'll buy more
buckets for next time.

After sanitation, you put a small amount of sugar—half a teaspoon or so—in each
bottle to allow for secondary fermentation, producing the gas in the bottle.
Too much sugar can cause the bottles to explode, so I was fairly conservative
in my estimate of ‘half a teaspoon’. I then filled the bottles with beer, using
the siphon and leaving about 2 cm of air at the top, and capped them. At this
point, all of the work is done (except for cleaning up). The beer should now be
left alone for about two weeks to ferment.

### The results

I was quite pleased with both the look and the taste of my brew. The particular
malt extract I used was [Cooper's Draught][Coopers], and while the brew touched
neither keg nor cask, it did resemble commercial beers marketed as ‘draught’
beer. The color is a bright orangey yellow, and the taste is clean, slightly
bitter and fairly light. I should note that, as I've left the beer behind in
my flat and traveled elsewhere for the holidays, I'm writing this from memory.
The beer may also benefit from the time that's passed since, as I had to cut
the two-week secondary fermentation period a bit short in order to try the beer
before I left.

### Closing thoughts

I chose a lager as my first beer as I've heard that they're more difficult to
mess up than darker beers—I expect I'll try something else for my next brew
and see how that goes. I've also found that, for my next batch, I'll need more
buckets for the sanitation process, as well as a thermometer for measuring the
temperature of the wort prior to adding yeast; guesstimating by dripping wort
onto my wrists felt all too unscientific, and it left me wondering whether the
wort was too cold or not.

Those were minor issues, though, and I'm happy with my first foray into
homebrewing. With this small measure of brewing experience, combined with my
much greater experience of drinking beer homebrewed by others, it's safe to
say that I'd recommend homebrewing to anyone who thinks they might enjoy it.
The beers are generally better, and certainly considerably cheaper than the
standard commercial beers available in my home country of Norway. Homebrewing
is also a quite satisfying activity which is easily shared with friends.
