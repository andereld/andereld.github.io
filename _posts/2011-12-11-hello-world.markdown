Hi there, and welcome to my site!

I'd like to take this opportunity to let you know what kind of content you
might find here in the future; unfortunately, I'm not completely sure myself.
Suffice it to say that it will probably include tidbits of technical banter,
seeing as my primary goal in creating this site is to educate myself in the
ways of [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org) and in server maintenance.

Other possible subjects include various kinds of culture things&mdash;music,
photography, film or fine ale; who knows? I may never write a post
again. Anyway, look around if you want. If not, why not read some
[xkcd](http://xkcd.com)?
