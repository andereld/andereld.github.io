About three months ago, I brewed my first batch of beer and wrote a
[post][post] about it on this site. I've since become a member of a newly
formed special interest group for the brewing of beer, AbaBrygg (AbaBrew),
which falls under [Abakus][Abakus]—an organization for students of computer
science and communications technology at [my university][NTNU]. This post
describes some of the experiences I've had on my continued brewing odyssey.

A fellow AbaBrygg member and I recently recently brewed about 40 l of stout,
constituting one out of four beers presented at a beer tasting event earlier
this month. (This was one of several events celebrating the 35th anniversary of
Abakus.) The brewing process was much the same as the one I chronicled in my
previous post. The only notable difference, except the obvious difference in
malt extract, was that we added a 50–50 mixture of dextrose and spray malt to
the brew, rather than add only dextrose. The text on the spray malt packaging
advertised that the product would “improve the body, adding extra rich malt
flavour and natural colours”. Not having done an A–B comparison, I can't
say whether it actually did, but it seemed like a good thing to do. At any
rate, the beer turned out quite nicely, and it was well-received at the beer
tasting event.

One thing I learned in preparing the beer for this would-be mass consumption,
is how to attach labels to bottles—or, at least, one of the ways to do so.
It is surprisingly simple; having printed and cut your labels, using ordinary
printing paper, simply dip a label into a bowl of milk and place it on a
bottle. The milk will dry in less than an hour, making the label stick more
firmly to the bottle than it would using whatever adhesive is commonly used
for commercially bottled beer. I also wiped excess milk from the label using a
tissue, as it tends to run down the bottle otherwise. As you might imagine, the
room I did the labeling in did smell of milk for a short while, but the labeled
bottles did not—so you needn't worry about your beer bottles smelling like
milk gone bad should you use this method.
