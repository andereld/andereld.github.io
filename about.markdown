# About me

My name is Anders Wold Eldhuset, and this is my website. I study computer
science at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology][NTNU]. When
I'm not studying, I develop web applications for the student organization
[Studentersamfundet i Trondhjem][samfundet]. I also write for the student
newspaper [readme][readme].

In addition to the site you're currently viewing, I maintain a web presence in
the following domains:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/andereld)
- [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/anders-wold-eldhuset/5b/185/991)
- [Google+](https://plus.google.com/113650343243081740523?rel=author)

If you'd like to contact me, you can send an email to **anders** at
